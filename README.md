# WeatherPy

Python script that visualizes the weather of 500+ randomly selected cities from across the world of varying distance from the equator, pulls data from the OpenWeatherMap API for 
each city, and analyzes the resulting data.

The data points gathered include location, cloudiness, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Several linear regressions and visualizations were made to showcase the resulting data and the relationships between the different weather variables.

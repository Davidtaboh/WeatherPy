# WeatherPy

Python script that visualizes the weather of 500+ randomly selected cities from across the world of varying distance from the equator, pulls data from the OpenWeatherMap API for 
each city, and analyzes the resulting data.

The data points gathereed, besides location, include cloudiness, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Several linear regressions and visualizations are made to showcase the resulting data and the relationships between them

### Prerequisites

* Microsoft Excel
* Juypter Notebook

## Getting Started

* Download the Python file
* Download the data and make sure that the API key is working properly 
* Rune the file

### Installing

After downloading the data and the code, one should be able to run the code by opening up the code in Juypter Notebook and running it in the environment. Notice that the
data used is combined early on from the two CSV files.
